# Commit Message Guidelines

In this project, we follow a structured format for writing commit messages to ensure clarity and consistency. Please adhere to the following rules when writing commit messages:

## The Seven Rules for a Great Git Commit Message

1. **Separate subject from body with a blank line**  
   The subject and body should be distinct, with a single blank line separating them.

2. **Limit the subject line to 50 characters**  
   Keep the subject concise and to the point, ideally within 50 characters.

3. **Capitalize the subject line**  
   The first letter of the subject should always be capitalized.

4. **Do not end the subject line with a period**  
   Avoid using punctuation (such as periods) at the end of the subject line.

5. **Use the imperative mood in the subject line**  
   Write the subject line as if you’re commanding what the commit will do, e.g., “Fix bug” instead of “Fixed bug” or “Fixes bug.”

6. **Wrap the body at 72 characters**  
   The body of the commit message should be wrapped at 72 characters for readability.

7. **Use the body to explain what and why vs. how**  
   Use the body to explain the "what" and "why" of the change. Focus on the reason for the change, and avoid detailing the implementation unless it's necessary for context.
