# Practice for Odin Project

This repository is not for an official project but contains practice files I created while following The Odin Project tutorial.

It mainly focuses on full-stack development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Ruby on Rails.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the webpages.
- **Git**: For version control.
- **Linux System**: For setting up the development environment and managing files.

## Official Projects
- **Odin Recipe**: A simple recipe website created using HTML. You can view it here: [Odin Recipes](https://zuna0hu.github.io/odin-recipes/)
