# Box Model
On a webpage, every element is represented as a rectangular box. You can control the size and spacing of these boxes using **padding**, **border**, and **margin**.


## Padding
Padding adds space between the content of a box and its border, increasing the internal spacing within the box.

## Border
Border adds a visible edge around the box and separates the padding from the margin.

## Margin
Margin creates space between the border of a box and the borders of adjacent boxes, affecting the external spacing around the box.
